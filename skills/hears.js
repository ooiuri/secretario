// Botkit is powered by "skills". For example this one is "hears"
// Basically the bot listens to to direct mentions and mentions (of the bot)
// and if it hears the word "!thanks" then the skill is triggered
// try changing the trigger word 
// here are the docs for more info https://botkit.ai/docs/v0/core.html
// and the Botkit Discord code which has some great examples! 
// https://github.com/brh55/botkit-discord



module.exports = function(controller) {
  const prefix = '!';
  controller.hears("thanks", ['direct_mention','ambient'], (bot, message) => {
    
    let response;
    let sender = message.user;
    
    // Many bots use the this method but sometimes it doesn't work, for example if you mention more than one person
    //let recipient = message.mentions.users.last();
    
    
    // this method filters out any users that aren't bots
    // if you have a bot that does more administrative things like blocking people, you might want to filter even more
    // like filter out admins or the person sending the message
    // it's using Discord.js for all this, yep that's right you have access to everything in Botkit AND Discord.js
    // https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/master/class/User
    let recipient = message.mentions.users.filter(user => user.bot === false).last();

    // Try changing them or adding your own.
